   may not be submitted for assessment in this subject.  I understand that
   submitting for assessment work developed by or in collaboration with
   other students or non-students constitutes Academic Misconduct, and

   specification to any form of code authoring or assignment tutoring
   service, or drawing the attention of others to such services and code
   that may have been made available via such a service, may be regarded
   as Student General Misconduct (interfering with the teaching activities

   I understand that an allegation of Student General Misconduct may arise
   regardless of whether or not I personally make use of such solutions
